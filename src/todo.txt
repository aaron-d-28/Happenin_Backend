fix the graphql thing first

done
store all the users that has ever existed and have gone to a program in this db table which will have a table that will record the scheduler name,employee name
,program name and then the user name connect this with the mongo db and store all this info in there
{
[first well have to instal postgres then make a db then table name it with appropriate column with primary keys
table :
    event id
    employee id
    customer_user_id,
    date,
    time,
]
}

3
also then research if there is some way to do real time database for the current users thing in mongo db model

4
decide exactly how r you going to implement the functionality of employees and qr codes
a programme will hold all the users that were present into the databse (mysql??) no postgres
