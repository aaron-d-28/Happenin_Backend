fix the graphql thing first

done
store all the users that has ever existed and have gone to a program in this db table which will have a table that will record the scheduler name,employee name
,program name and then the user name connect this with the mongo db and store all this info in there
{
[first well have to instal postgres then make a db then table name it with appropriate column with primary keys
table :
    event id
    employee id
    customer_user_id,
    date,
    time,
]
}

3
also then research if there is some way to do real time database for the current users thing in mongo db model

4
decide exactly how r you going to implement the functionality of employees and qr codes
a programme will hold all the users that were present into the databse (mysql??) no postgres



db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      name: 1,
      dob: 1,
      age: {
        $divide: [
          { $subtract: [new Date(), "$dob"] }, // Current date - dob
          1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25        // Convert milliseconds to years
        ]
      }
    }
  }
])

 getUsersGroupedByCity: async () => {
      // MongoDB aggregation to group users by location_city
      const result = await User.aggregate([
        {
          $group: {
            _id: "$location_city", // Group by location_city
            users: { $push: "$$ROOT" } // Collect all users in the group
          }
        },
        {
          $project: {
            city: "$_id", // Rename _id to city
            users: 1,
            _id: 0
          }
        }
      ]);

      return result;
    }

first group by age then more than xyz
